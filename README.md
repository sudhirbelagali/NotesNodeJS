# NotesNodeJS
Notes application which uses local file to store all the notes - created using NodeJS - a beginners application
ExpressJS web framework is not used in this application, I have executed in the linux terminal 
I have learned to create this application from Udemy - Course instructor is Andrew J Mead 
Thanks
